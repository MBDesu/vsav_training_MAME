## About
A training mode for vsavj on MAME.

## Windows Installation 
  1. Copy `run_vsav_training.bat` to wherever your `mame.exe` is located. Make sure there are no spaces in the directory path.
  2. Copy the `scripts/` folder to the same place from step 1

## Use
### General
Press whatever key you use to bring up the MAME in-system menu (`TAB` by default) and navigate to `Plugin Options`. Here you will find myriad settings.

You may double click any numeric entries to type your own values. You must first press `BACKSPACE` to delete the old value, if desired. When you are finished, press `ENTER` or `ESCAPE` or double click the item once more or exit the MAME menu to save the setting.

Note that some values have numeric constraints; if you enter a value outside of a valid range, they will automatically be updated to reflect a valid value.

### Character Select
On character select, you may select a stage by pressing `COIN 1` on a character portrait. Each corresponds to a different stage. Random will return the selection to random.
